# minstrument
Utility to copy music albums into structured hierarchy of directories. Also it can copy tag into newly converted tracks. At this moment minstrument works with flac and ogg using metaflack and vorbiscomment.
Program will ask you to create config file if it doesn't exits, where you can specify music dir and alternative way to get tags.
